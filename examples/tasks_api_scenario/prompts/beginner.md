I need help setting up monitoring for my Task API service.

I want to track:
- How fast requests are (latency)
- How many errors we're getting
- Which requests are too slow (over 500ms)
- Overall traffic volume

I also need:
- An availability SLO (99.9% uptime)
- A latency SLO (most requests under 500ms)
- Alerts when things go wrong
- A dashboard to see everything

Can you create the monitoring files for me?
